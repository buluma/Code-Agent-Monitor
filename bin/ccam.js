/**
 * @file ccam — the Claude Code Agent Monitor command-line interface.
 *
 * Thin executable entry point. The CLI itself lives in ../cli/: a
 * Commander.js command tree (cli/index.js) with shared conventions in
 * cli/lib/framework.js, command modules in cli/commands/, and the
 * interactive shell in cli/repl.js. After `npm run setup` (which links this
 * binary via `npm link`) every command is available as `ccam <command>`;
 * `ccam help` lists them and `ccam commands --json` describes them for
 * machines.
 *
 * Resolved through the REAL path of this file so the global symlink `npm
 * link` creates still finds the checkout's cli/ and node_modules/.
