 * directory, so the root manifest is normally one level up. It falls back to the client manifest,

 * stage that only copies `client/`). The global is declared in `client/src/vite-env.d.ts`.

 * Port of the dashboard server the dev proxy forwards to. Honors `DASHBOARD_PORT`, so the proxy
 * follows when `npm run dev:server` is moved off the default 4820 (for example when an SSH
 * `LocalForward` already holds 4820 on `127.0.0.1` and `::1`). The dev server reads the same
 * variable from `server/index.js`, so a single `DASHBOARD_PORT=4821 npm run dev` keeps both sides
 * in step.
 *
 * The proxy targets `127.0.0.1` rather than `localhost`: when several listeners share a port across
 * IP families (loopback-specific SSH binds and Node's wildcard listen), macOS routes connections by
 * socket specificity, so `localhost` can reach the wrong process. An explicit IPv4 loopback is also
 * what the embedded production server binds to.
